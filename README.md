# Game: Guess the Number!

This is a simple game written in Python where the player has to guess a number within a selected range.

## How to Play

1. Choose the difficulty level:
   - 1: Easy (1–10)
   - 2: Intermediate (1–50)
   - 3: Hard (1–100)
2. Enter a number to try to guess the randomly generated number.
3. The program will give you clues to let you know if you’re close or not. For example, if your guess is within 2 numbers (higher or lower), it will notify you that you're close.
4. You have 7 attempts.
5. The game ends when you guess the number or run out of attempts.

## Validation

- You cannot enter numbers you've already tried.
- Invalid inputs are not accepted.
